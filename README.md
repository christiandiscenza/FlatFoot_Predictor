# FlatFoot_Predictor
This is the repository for the degree project in IT for University of Molise - Relator Francesco Mercaldo 

The idea consist to create a neural network that can recognize a flatfoot in an image. 
It's necessary to train the NN to gaan a lot of data in a dataset of images and a .csv file with some attributes for evry image; so the NN can learn and help orthopedics to recognize a flaatfoot in less time.
